# Image-Classification-Methods

This repository showcases the implementation of four different methods for image classification on the Natural Images dataset, consisting of 256x256 images with eight classes.

The project includes the following methods:

1. MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)
2. CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
3. Residual Neural Network
4. EfficientNet with Transfer Learning

The code is structured using classes, providing a clear and organized implementation. The notebook is self-explanatory, guiding users through the project's steps and methodologies.
